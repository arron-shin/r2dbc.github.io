Dear R2DBC Community,

We are thrilled to announce the second first milestone of the R2DBC 0.9 specification (`0.9.0.M2`) that ships several changes. One of them is a long-awaited feature to consume out parameters from stored procedures. 
Here's a short summary of the changes:

* Consumption of OUT Parameters by introducing [`OutParameters`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/OutParameters.html). `Row` and `OutParameters` now share the common superinterface [`Readable`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Readable.html).
* Introduction of the [`Result.map(Function<Readable, T>)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Result.html#map-java.util.function.Function-) method.
* Introduction of the [`Result.Segment`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Result.Segment.html) API type hierarchy and `Result.filter(Predicate<Segment>)` and `Result.flatMap(Function<Segment, Publisher<T>>)` methods to consume arbitrary statement results.
* Lifecycle support by introducing the [`Lifecycle`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Lifecycle.html) interface.
* Removal of generic type of [`ConnectionFactoryOptions.getValue(Option)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/ConnectionFactoryOptions.html#getValue-io.r2dbc.spi.Option-) and `getRequiredValue(â€¦)`.
* Deprecate `RowMetadata.getColumnNames()` and introduce [`RowMetadata.contains(String)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/RowMetadata.html#contains-java.lang.String-) to simplify constraints and usage around column presence checks.
* Support for Lock Wait and Statement Timeouts through [`Connection.setLockWaitTimeout(Duration)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Connection.html#setLockWaitTimeout-java.time.Duration-) and [`Connection.setStatementTimeout(Duration)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.M2/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Connection.html#setStatementTimeout-java.time.Duration-) methods.

This release provides a stable revision of the specification for R2DBC implementors. We expect drivers and implementations to adopt these changes within the next weeks so that we can expect implementations to be available during August where we plan to finish the milestone release train with the bill of materials.
