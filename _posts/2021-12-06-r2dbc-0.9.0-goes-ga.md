Dear community,

It is my pleasure to announce the general availability of R2DBC `0.9.0.RELEASE` from Maven Central!

This revision of the R2DBC specification has been in the works for roughly two years and ships numerous enhancements to the SPI and specification:

* Extensible [Transaction Definitions](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/TransactionDefinition.html).
* Improved [Bind-Parameter Declaration](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Parameters.html)
* Consumption of OUT Parameters by introducing [`OutParameters`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/OutParameters.html). `Row` and `OutParameters` now share the common superinterface [`Readable`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Readable.html).
* Introduction of the [`Result.map(Function<Readable, T>)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Result.html#map-java.util.function.Function-) method.
* Introduction of the [`Result.Segment`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Result.Segment.html) API type hierarchy and `Result.filter(Predicate<Segment>)` and `Result.flatMap(Function<Segment, Publisher<T>>)` methods to consume arbitrary statement results.
* Lifecycle support by introducing the [`Lifecycle`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Lifecycle.html) interface.
* Removal of generic type of [`ConnectionFactoryOptions.getValue(Option)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/ConnectionFactoryOptions.html#getValue-io.r2dbc.spi.Option-) and `getRequiredValue(â€¦)`.
* Deprecate `RowMetadata.getColumnNames()` and introduce [`RowMetadata.contains(String)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/RowMetadata.html#contains-java.lang.String-) to simplify constraints and usage around column presence checks.
* Support for Lock Wait and Statement Timeouts through [`Connection.setLockWaitTimeout(Duration)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Connection.html#setLockWaitTimeout-java.time.Duration-) and [`Connection.setStatementTimeout(Duration)`](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.0.RELEASE/api/io/r2dbc/spi/Connection.html#setStatementTimeout-java.time.Duration-) methods.

In order to make the specification consumable, R2DBC implementors can now pick up the specification and ship releases of their drivers.
Looking forward, we expect a release train release (`r2dbc-bom` code name Borca-GA) in early February 2022. Until then, try out RC-level releases of R2DBC drivers and learn about the new and noteworthy:
